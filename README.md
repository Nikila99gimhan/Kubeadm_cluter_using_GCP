Certainly! Below is a step-by-step guide for starting with a free tier account in GCP, installing the GCP SDK, and setting up the environment to create a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm`:

## Set Up a GCP Free Tier Account & Install the GCP SDK

### Step 1: Sign up for GCP's Free Tier

1. Go to the Google Cloud [Free Tier page](https://cloud.google.com/free).
2. Click on `Get started for free`.
3. Log in with your Google account or create a new one.
4. Follow the prompts to select your country and agree to the terms of service.
5. Set up your billing information. **Note**: While you need to provide a credit card or billing method, the free tier has generous limits that will not be charged unless you exceed those limits.

### Step 2: Install Google Cloud SDK

#### For macOS:

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew cask install google-cloud-sdk
```

#### For Linux:

```bash
# Download the SDK installer
curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-sdk-<VERSION>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

# Extract the archive
tar zxvf google-cloud-sdk-<VERSION>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

# Navigate to the SDK directory
cd google-cloud-sdk

# Run the install script
./install.sh
```

Replace `<VERSION>` with the appropriate SDK version from the [official page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-versioned-archives).

#### For Windows:

1. Download the interactive installer from the [official SDK downloads page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive).
2. Launch the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Step 3: Initialize the SDK

After installation, you'll need to authenticate and set some default properties:

```bash
gcloud init
```

1. When prompted, log in using the same Google account you used to sign up for GCP's free tier.
2. Select a project or create a new one.
3. Choose a default Compute Engine zone (e.g., `us-central1-a`).
4. Confirm the changes and finish the setup.
